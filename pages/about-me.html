        <h2>A little about me right now</h2>
        <p>Hello! Welcome to KingZCoding.com! I am King! Nice to meet you! This website you're on right now is the very beginning of my coding career. 
        I am starting the intial build (7/2/2024) of this right after learning the html basics and the intro into css from <a href="https://theodinproject.com">theodinproject.com!</a> 
        My ultimate end goal with learning to code is to become a game devolper/full stack dev to pursue my passion and love for computers. We'll talk a little more about that later on tho lets get to more of who i am. 
        I am a 26 year old male from New Jersey with 2 beautiful baby boys ages 13 months and 3 weeks. I met my beautiful wife in feburary of 2020. All I can say is it was love at first sight. 
        We currently live with my mother back home in New Jersey while we try to save up for our own place with this terrible economy we have right now. I love to play video games, code, work on cars, and most importantly spend time with my amazing family.
        I am a Tire Technician during the day and a coder/daddy at night. Might be related to Superman but I don't know yet. I'll let you guys know if I start shooting beams out of my eyes or lifting cars with one hand!
