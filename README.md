# mywebsite
Hello! My name is King pin and i am the sole creator and (learning) devolper for KingZCoding!
This is my first very own personal project after completing the html lessons and the begining lessons of css
from theodinproject.com. My ultimate end goal from doing theodinproject is to learn the basic foundations, html, css, js, and node.js
and then continue pushing foward all the way to a game devolper/full stack dev. This project is going to be my first make up of my peronal website
that I intend to continue to build and grow as I progress through theodinproject.com with adding new things I learn from the classes until I have finished
theodinproject and ultimately my personal website with my portolio of work, contact info, services, and anything else we may decide to add. Alright enough talking lets get working. i will add commit messages of what i do to each upload if anyone is interested in following along with my project! As well as edit messages in the README.md when important changes to code or the website come about! 

First Edit: Adding pages, img, and styles dir. Intial set up of index.html/index.css and about-me.html/aboutme.css

Second edit: Adding flex to webpage
